 3. Create a salesforcebulk trial account and derive the API Token.
   i)    Using the URL "https://www.salesforce.com/" create a salesforcebulk trial account.
   ii)   Using the URL "https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_understanding_authentication.htm" setup the connected app, get the 'client id','client secret' and obtain the 'Access Token' and 'Refresh Token'.
   iii)  Create a job which has 'CSV' content type and object value should be 'Contact' by using the URL "https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/binary_create_job.htm".
   iv)   Create a .txt file by referring the URL "https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/binary_create_job.htm" and place it under <SALESFORCEBULK_CONNECTOR_HOME>/src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/config/resources/salesforcebulk/.
   v)    Create a .csv file by referring the URL "https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/datafiles_csv_sample_file.htm" and place it under <SALESFORCEBULK_CONNECTOR_HOME>/src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/config/resources/salesforcebulk/.

   Hint:

       Getting Authorization Code: Make a 'GET' call to https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<client_id>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>
       Getting Access Token      : Make a 'POST' call to  https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token?client_secret=<client_secret>&client_id=<client_id>&grant_type=authorization_code&code=<code>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>
